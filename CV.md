## Projects

All independently designed and implemented:

1. **Transformer Language Model** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/xycoord/Language-Modelling/)  
  From-scratch PyTorch implementation with KV caching and RoPE [[Blog Post]](https://loganthomson.com/RoPE/).  
  Modular architecture emphasising code clarity and understanding.  

2. **Reinforcement Learning Course** [[Part 1]](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lm_TI-Vrzai-WZQeZL3o7US07vVKWXlQ) [[Part 2]](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UULTQYnymQOpa7nuaw6mDXnvWRV9R_2y)  
  Teaching RL through rigorous mathematical derivations and implementations from first principles.  

3. **BPE Tokeniser** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/xycoord/Language-Modelling/tree/main/src/lm_tokenizers) [[Blog Post]](https://loganthomson.com/Optimising-BPE/)  
  Optimised training implementation (hours â†’ 13s) with systematic profiling.  

4. **4th-Year Research Project** (Supervised by Ronald Clark) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/xycoord/Transparency-Segmentation) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BvU4-v3jf7onxT1T6RyVTEVyawAkavyV/view?usp=drive_link)  
  Fine-tuned diffusion models for image segmentation of transparent objects.  
  Implemented and evaluated NeRF methods which learn how light bends in a scene.  

I also enjoy reading mech interp and alignment papers.
