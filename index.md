My recent projects deconstruct LLM components by implementing them myself and explaining the underlying theory:

[**[Transformer LM]**](https://github.com/xycoord/Language-Modelling/) | From-scratch implementation featuring RoPE and KV cache, emphasis on code quality and clarity
[**[RL Course]**](https://github.com/xycoord/deep-rl-course) | Teaching RL through rigorous mathematical derivations and implementations from first principles
[**[BPE Tokeniser]**](./Optimising-BPE) | Optimised training implementation (hours → 13s) with detailed technical writeup

I also enjoy reading mech interp and alignment papers.
